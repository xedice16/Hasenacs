The tote is the perfect companion for shopping trips, beach days and even work days when we need to pack everything and the kitchen sink, after all we love to be as organised as Mary Poppins when we can be. ",
            "Fast forward those moments to where we only need the bare minimum, think our phones, card wallets and a lip colour, suddenly a tote is trend overkill. This fall the iconic vanity bag is back and every brand that's worth its salt has created their take.",
            "Max Mara have us covered with their beautifully chic takes, Gucci inject a little fun with their larger than life styles and Self-Portrait as always lead the pack for those special moments in time. No matter the event, no matter your style, no matter the budget; the vanity bag is back and we've rounded up the most iconic of them all. ",

        mainDesc: ['The first step is to clean your jewelry before storing it because jewelry that isn’t maintained can lead to damage to precious and semi-precious gemstones and cause the metals to tarnish. Brittany’s recommends that you have your jewelry professionally inspected and cleaned twice yearly. ',
            '1. Fine Jewelry: You can clean your fine jewelry about every month using a gentle method but leave the ultrasonic cleaning to professionals because they watch closely for loose stones and advise on how to correct them.  A common cleaning method that you can do at home is use lukewarm water in a bowl, a soft toothbrush, and mild dishwashing detergent. You can use the toothbrush to very delicately brush away dirt and debris, taking note of loose gemstones. If you find any, don’t wear the piece again until you’ve had it professionally repaired. Finally, gently pat the jewelry dry before you store it. ',
            '2. Silver Jewelry: You can use effective silver polish to clean your silver jewelry or make your own at-home version with tinfoil, baking soda, salt, and water. Line a pan with aluminum foil and put the jewelry on top. Next, sprinkle some baking soda and salt on top of the jewelry, around 1 tablespoon per cup of water. Then, pour boiling water on the pan until the items are saturated and let them sit in the solution for a few minutes. Remove the jewelry and pat it dry with a lint-free cloth.  Be sure not to expose your karat gold jewelry to this solution. ',
